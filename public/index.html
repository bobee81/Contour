      <h2 class="header--margin header--subtitle">A musical collaboration and exchange between icelandic and global artists</h2>

      <p>Everyone who loves Icelandic music might recognise this. You are at a big festival, you popped in a tent where Sigur Ros plays, and suddenly you are sucked in their fabulous music adventure. They blow you away! Everyone seems to feel the same vibe. People look amazed to each other, minutes after their show. As an artist, you might ask yourself over and over again, how can an island which has a small number of habitats contains so much talented and prominent artists?</p>

      <p>Our goal is to share this experience. But more of that, why not combine forces to get inspired from each other? Our aim is to encourage more international artists to come to Iceland and to connect them with Icelandic artists to exchange ideas, collaborate and perform together. Further than that, we will curate their travels in the way that we’ll organise at least one concert during their stay, help them with accommodation and help getting the finances together for the trip.</p>

      <p>Together with the artists, we will help with finding the right fit for a collaboration with Icelandic musicians, but also with further artists such as photographers, videographers, visual artists etc. The program will include - depending on the artists’ interests - co-writing sessions, film/photo sessions, audio recordings or anything else what the artists have in mind. At the same time, we’ll help Icelandic artists to do the same abroad - either together with their international collaboration partners who already worked with them in Iceland, or with other artists and new collaborators.</p>
